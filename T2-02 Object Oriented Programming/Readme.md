Seconds |  A logic error produces unintended or undesired output or other behaviour | A program crash is the most noticeable type of runtime error, since the program unexpectedly quits while running. Crashes can be caused by memory leaks or other programming errors. | A syntax error is an error in the source code of a program. Since computer programs must follow strict syntax to compile correctly, any aspects of the code that do not conform to the syntax of the programming language will produce a syntax error. | 286 | 289 | 285 | 287 | 287 | 272 | 276 | 269
